# Plane Sailing Server

Server-side code for Plane/Sailing version 2.

Currently under construction - this does not do anything very useful yet, and the Plane/Sailing web interface does not talk to it.

## To Do List

* Implement APRS Receive via Direwolf - client to host:8000
* Refactor TCP client to make common between SBS and APRS
* Switch AIS to TCP client too to match? Requires new rtl_ais compile from source
